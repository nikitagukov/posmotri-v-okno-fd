# Look out the window 

“Look Out the Window” is a web application for taking your mind off writing code and relaxing. You'll see what someone on the Practicum team sees when they're not looking at code, but looking out the window. 

Type in the name of the city, select the time of day, and click “Find”. Or you can choose a video from the list of previews on the right. 

Maybe someday I'll add more cities (if I have the strength to finish my web development degree :-)
